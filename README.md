This project was undertaken for **Best Cart**, a client looking to reduce waste in their mini-marts and improve inventory planning. The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales trends, product performance, and consumer behavior, aimed at identifying areas for inventory optimization. The goal is to ensure the right products are stocked at the right times, while minimizing waste from unsold or underperforming items.

## Data Summary

### Key Metrics
- **Total Revenue**: $21.0M
- **Total Sales**: 6.6M units
- **Sales per Day**: 57.6K units
- **Best-Selling Product**: Regular Coffee
- **Top Selling Product Categories**: Food, Snacks, and Alcoholic Beverages

### Best Selling Products
The top-selling products include:
1. **Regular Coffee**: 3.34M units sold, $8.36M in revenue
2. **Caramel Chocolate Bar**
3. **Grilled Cheese**
4. **Small Chips (60g)**
5. **Brussel Special 4-Pack** (Premium)
6. **Soda (50CL)**

### Categories Performance

- **Snacks**: Second largest category with 1.26M orders
- **Alcoholic Beverages, Tobacco, and Non-Alcoholic Beverages**: Moderate sales in comparison
- **Non-Food & Groceries**: Very low sales performance

## Key Insights
1. **Frozen Foods Do Not Sell**: Frozen foods see minimal sales, suggesting they take up unnecessary shelf space and contribute to inventory waste.
   
2. **General Merchandise Underperformance**: Similar to frozen foods, general merchandise has poor sales, highlighting an opportunity to either phase out these items or refresh the product range.

3. **Holiday Sales Peaks**: Local holidays bring significant spikes in sales, indicating that inventory should be adjusted to meet the increased demand during these periods.

4. **Regular Coffee Dominates**: Regular coffee is the best-selling product, demonstrating strong and consistent demand. This suggests maintaining or expanding coffee-related products is crucial for sales growth.

5. **Budget Items Outperform Premium**: Budget items, such as snacks and drinks, significantly outperform premium options, pointing to a price-sensitive customer base that favors affordable products.

6. **Seasonal Product Peaks**: Products like ice cream, barbeque lighting fluid, and seasonal cookies see high demand during specific times, requiring careful stock planning to avoid overstocking during off-peak periods.

## Recommendations for Waste Reduction & Inventory Optimization

1. **Phase Out Frozen Foods**: Due to poor sales performance, it is recommended to phase out frozen foods to reduce waste and free up valuable shelf space for more profitable items.

2. **Refresh or Remove General Merchandise**: Either discontinue or revamp the general merchandise line, focusing on products that better align with consumer demand.

3. **Optimize Holiday Inventory**: Stock up on high-demand items like snacks, beverages, and regular coffee ahead of local holidays to meet the increased demand and reduce stockouts.

4. **Expand Coffee Product Line**: Introduce more varieties and sizes of coffee, leveraging the strong demand for regular coffee to boost sales and minimize waste from unsold alternatives.

5. **Focus on Budget Items**: Increase the range of budget-friendly items, as they consistently outperform premium products. This will cater to customer preferences and reduce unsold premium stock.

6. **Strategic Stocking of Seasonal Products**: Ensure that highly seasonal items, such as ice cream and barbeque essentials, only occupy shelf space during their peak sales periods to avoid waste from unsold stock during off-peak times.

7. **Introduce Meal Deals**: Offer meal deals that combine popular items like sandwiches, snacks, and beverages. This not only encourages higher purchase volumes but also helps to reduce waste by bundling products with a shorter shelf life.

## Conclusion

By using data-driven insights from the Exec Dashboard, **Best Cart** can significantly reduce waste and improve inventory planning in their mini-marts. The analysis highlights areas where inventory can be streamlined, such as phasing out low-performing categories like frozen foods, while increasing stock of high-demand items such as regular coffee and budget products. Strategic stocking around holidays and seasonal peaks will further ensure that Best Cart minimizes waste and maximizes sales.
